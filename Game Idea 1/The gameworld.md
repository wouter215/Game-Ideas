## The World
This game takes place within a small city state. Located in Random-place, this small nation sits isolated between two superpowers. (Superpowers relative to this city state that is...)

Simply called "The City", this nation has great ties with almost all nations of the world, housing many large office buildings and high tech industry. The City does not, however, get along well with its jealous neighbors. This has caused its government to take a more freedoms restricting pose.

The technology in this world didn't quite go the same way as it did ours. while networking and internet are ubiquitous, fancy graphics are not, resulting is almost all displays to show only in text mode. (or at least, that's how its shown to the player.)

Software wise the world is dominated by a single monolithic company, MegaHard (or evil corp, etc). The operating system people, and the government use is made exclusively by this company. It also makes office applications.  
This corporation wishes to monopolize all computer use, but is thwarted by its last real competitor: Other-company (like how Apple is vs Microsoft)  
There's also a open source alternative (i.e. Linux), but it's not very usable to the average user and is therefore used mostly by hobbyists and hackers.
